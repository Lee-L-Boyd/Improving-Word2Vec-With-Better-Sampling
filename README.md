# Improving-Word2Vec-With-Better-Sampling
This project seeks to improve Word2Vec by better down-sampling, both positive and negative using a variety of statistics.
This project was academic in nature and as such unit testing was not performed as would be done for industry level research and development.  The project contains files from multiple sources.  Primarily the sources can be divided into a MapReduce cluster and a GPU development environment using Tensorflow.
The data files have been excluded for the efficient use of space.  Most data files could be generated given the Wikipedia corpus and proper setup.  
This project is primarily to showcase the coding behind the experimentation and is not intended to be rerun without proper refactoring.
